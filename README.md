# MT Marathon 2024 - Terminologies

This code was developed at the MT Marathon in Prague 2024 as part of a task investigating
methods to provide contextual terminology to MT.

The code in the repo attempts to LLM (Mistral 7B instruct for now) and use terminologies
using the method of injecting into the prompt as per the paper [Dictionary-based Phrase-level Prompting of Large Language Models
for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07856).
